# Bomberman 2

The game we designed in Bomberman-1 was all based on luck. Let's extend the same game with the same <strong><code>10x10 grid</code></strong> and try to help our fellow users get a path to win. But how?
 

 <ul>
 Whenever a user clicks on a cell he/she should be able to see a number based on the following conditions:
 <li>Consider a rectangular area around the cell clicked.</li>
 <li>Calculate the number of bombs contained in that area.</li>

 <li>Display the number in the cell.</li>
 </ul>
 

 One might think what about the cells at the extreme edges
 

 <b>Worry Not!
 Consider the following images. These will help you consider various edge cases.

 <b>How will it help?</b>
 By clicking on various cells user may be able deduce which cells contain bombs. Following the same pattern the user may complete the game.
 

 <b>Users first! üôè</b>
 You have helped users a lot by guiding them the path, but what if they could remember their conclusions out of those helping paths?
 For example: The user is sure that some cell contains a bomb, they may want to remember it so that they don't have to make calculations again and again.
 

 <b>Let's get to the point.</b>
 Give the users an option to flag a cell as follows:
 

 When users right-clicks on a cell they should see something like this.

 <br>
 This way users can remember that they concluded there's a bomb in that cell and should not click it. If a user left-clicks on this flagged cell, normal flow should continue.
 

 <b>Time for celebration üéâ</b>
 If a user has scored <strong>90</strong> points it means he has clicked all the safe cells or flagged all the <strong>10</strong> bombs. A message should be displayed on the screen saying "YOU WIN!". Otherwise "YOU LOSE!".
